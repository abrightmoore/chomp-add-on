Have you ever wondered why all that space up in your face isn't being put to better use? No? Well, never mind: Chomp Add-On takes care of that problem. With this Add-On you can extract and replace Teeth, craft Chatters, enhance Iron Swords, and make Spiked Carpet traps! There's loads of new content and a great new mechanic.
